# hello-world
My first repository

Hello, my name is ArabD. I am wanting to learn how to code apps and I heard Github was a good place to learn. The first language I will learn is Java - I've been told it is the best way to start learning how to code Apps.

My interests are music, sport (football, badminton, running).
I've some ideas for apps that could benefit those in debt, as well as ideas for augmented reality tools.

Hello Github. Hello World!
